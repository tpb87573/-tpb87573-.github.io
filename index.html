			<p> The New England Patriots are a professional football team that competes in the NFL as an AFC East team. They are located in the Greater Boston Area and play their home games at Gilette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts. Their colors are red, navy blue, silver and white, and their mascot is Pat Patriot. The Patriots played their first home game at Foxboro Stadium in 1971, and switched over to Gilette Stadium in 2002. The Patriots' rivalry with the New York Jets is one of the worst in the NFL. </p>
			<p> The Patriots have been to the Super Bowl eigth times, six of which were under current head coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady. Belichick and Brady also hold the record for most Super Bowls reached by a coach-quarterback pair, as well as being the first pair to win the Super Bowl 14 years after the first. The Patriots are also considered one of the most successful teams in the NFL, as they have won twelve AFC East titles in 14 seasons beginning in 2001. They had no losing season in that period of time. The Patriots have also set records including most wins in a ten-year period, an undefeated 16-game regular season in 2007, and the longest winning streak consisitng of regular season games in NFL history. </p>
			<p> As a Boston native, I am a huge fan of the Patriots. Currently, my favorite player is Rob Gronkowski, known for his famous touchdown celebration the "Gronk spike." My family is an avid football family, and will always host parties to watch the games every Sunday in the fall. I have watched many football games inside Gilette stadium, as well as New England Revolution soccer games and countless concerts. Foxborough is a home away from home to me, and is somewhere I love to go as much as possible. Patriot's Place, the complex around the stadium, holds some of my favorite stores and restauarnts. This makes attending games so much more fun because there is always so much to do, you'll never be bored! </p>

<p> The Patriots have had an impressive history, and this year’s season is following suit! Being a Bostonian in an Atlanta dominated area has made me some friends, and also some enemies. But anytime someone tries to tell me the Patriots aren’t the best in the league, I just show them <a href=" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A2kR-eOqqk/" target=”_blank”> this! </a>
